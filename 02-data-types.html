        JavaScript has the concept of primitive data types.
        Specifically, we're going to spend some time focusing on strings, numbers, boolean and undefined/null.

        Strings
        First up, let's talk about everyone's favorite: strings.

        Strings are letters, numbers, emojis, and any type of character you see on the keyboard.

        The only catch is that you have to use a single quote, double quote or backticks to surround the variable value.

        But for now, you can use single quotes or double quotes.

        There are no types of performance boost or any other advantages.

        So you choose the one that you like the most.

        I'll be using double quotes for our examples.

        First, we'll create a new variable with a string data type called palindrome.

        That's a word that's the same backwards and forwards.

        My absolute favorite palindrome is "tacocat".

        Numbers
        Numbers are a core part of programming because we are always counting or calculating something.

        But don't worry, I'm not about to hit you with some advanced calculus or statistics here.

        Let's dive into how numbers work in JavaScript.


        Numbers can be positive, negative whole numbers, or even be numbers with decimals.

        Alright, let's take a quick aside to discuss the naming convention for variables.

        There are lots of ways to type variable name, but in JavaScript, we usually see camelCase.

        That means the first word is lowercase and then the next word has a capital first letter and you repeat this
        process.

        In our example, we have number, all lower case, O for of is capital O, lowercase f, and then a capital C for
        Concerts.

    <script>
        const palinfrome = "tacocat";
        const occupation = " Hand Model";
        const password = "12357@asA**7#!~";

        const apy = 1.5;
        const numberOfConcerts = 1000;

        const isOlderThan31 = false;
        const hasNewCarSmell = true;

    </script>
